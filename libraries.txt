    Implementation and Libraries of the project:

First starting with my backend functionality of the code the mainly used libraries and description are as follows:
> pip install fastapi - Used for creating web APIs with Python.
> pip install fuzzywuzzy: Used for fuzzy string matching.
> pip install google-cloud-vision: Used for interacting with Google Cloud Vision API for text detection in images.
> pip install requests: Used for making HTTP requests to your FastAPI backend.
> pip install scikit-learn: Used for machine learning tasks such as vectorization and nearest neighbors search.
> pip install uvicorn: ASGI server used to run the FastAPI application.

To run my backend code you need to go to terminal and then run the following command:

uvicorn main:app --reload


Now I want to explain about my front-end functionality:

Using Base64 encoding for images is a common practice

I majorly used two libraries:

> pip install streamlit: install the Streamlit library, a popular Python framework for building interactive web applications with simple Python scripts.
> pip install requests: Used for making HTTP requests to your streamlit frontend.

The command you need to run for my frontend is:

streamlit run filename.py
